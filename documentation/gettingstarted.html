Getting Started With Smack

<p>
This document will introduce you to the Smack API and provide an overview of 
important classes and concepts.
</p>

<p class="subheader">
Requirements
</p>

The only requirement for Smack is JDK 1.2 or later. An XML parser is embedded in the smack.jar
file and no other third party libraries are required.

<p class="subheader">
Establishing a Connection
</p>

The <tt>XMPPConnection</tt> class is used to create a connection to an 
XMPP server. To create an SSL connection, use the SSLXMPPConnection class.
Below are code examples for making a connection:<p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<font color="gray"><i>// Create a connection to the jabber.org server.</i></font>
XMPPConnection conn1 = <font color="navy"><b>new</b></font> XMPPConnection(<font color="green">"jabber.org"</font>);

<font color="gray"><i>// Create a connection to the jabber.org server on a specific port.</i></font>
XMPPConnection conn2 = <font color="navy"><b>new</b></font> XMPPConnection(<font color="green">"jabber.org"</font>, 5222);

<font color="gray"><i>// Create an SSL connection to jabber.org.</i></font>
XMPPConnection connection = <font color="navy"><b>new</b></font> SSLXMPPConnection(<font color="green">"jabber.org"</font>); 
</pre></div>

<p>Once you've created a connection, you should login using a username and password
with the <tt>XMPPConnection.login(String username, String password)</tt> method.
Once you've logged in, you can being chatting with other users by creating
new <tt>Chat</tt> or <tt>GroupChat</tt> objects.

<p class="subheader">
Packets, the PacketReader, and the PacketWriter
</p>

Each message to the XMPP server from a client is called a packet and is
sent as XML. The <tt>org.jivesoftware.smack.packet</tt> package contains
classes that encapsulate the different packet types allowed by XMPP (message, 
presence, and IQ). Classes such as <tt>Chat</tt> and <tt>GroupChat</tt>
provide higher-level constructs that manage creating and sending packets
automatically, but you can also create and send packets directly. Below
is a code example for changing the presence to let people we're unavailable
because we're out fishing:<p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<font color="gray"><i>// Create a new presence. Pass in false to indicate we're unavailable.</i></font>
Presence presence = new Presence(false);
presence.setStatus(<font color="green">"Gone fishing"</font>);
<font color="gray"><i>// Send the packet (assume we have a XMPPConnection instance called "con").</i></font>
con.getPacketWriter().sendPacket(presence);
</pre></div>
<p>

Every connection has a <tt>PacketReader</tt> and <tt>PacketWriter</tt>. The
packet reader listens for XML data from the server and parses it into
individual packets. You can listen for incoming packets by registering
<tt>PacketWatcher</tt> objects with the packet reader. The packet writer
is responsible for writing packets to the server. It takes <tt>Packet</tt>
objects and converts them to XML before sending them over the network.
