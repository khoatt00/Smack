Debugging with Smack

<p>
Smack includes a built-in debugging console that will let you track all XML traffic between 
the client and server.
</p>

<p>
When debugging mode is enabled, a debug window will appear when each new connection is created.
The window will contain the following information:
</p>

<img src="images/debugwindow.gif" width="359" height="399" alt="" border="0" align="right">

<ul>
	<li>Client Traffic (red text) -- raw XML traffic generated by Smack and sent to the server.
    <li>Server Traffic (blue text) -- raw XML traffic sent by the server to the client.
    <li>Interpreted Packets (green text) -- shows XML packets from the server as parsed by Smack.
</ul>

<p>
Debugging mode can be enabled in two different ways:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Add the following line of code before creating new connections:<p> 
		<tt>XMPPConection.DEBUG_ENABLED = true;</tt><p>

	<li>Set the Java system property <tt>smack.debugEnabled</tt> to true. The 
		system property can be set on the command line such as:<p> 
		<tt>java -Dsmack.debugEnabled=true SomeApp </tt>
</ol>

<p>
If you wish to explicity disable debug mode in your application, including using the command-line parameter, 
add the following line to your application before opening new connections:
</p>

<p>
<tt>XMPPConnection.DEBUG_ENABLED = false;</tt>
</p>
